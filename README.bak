CATG
----

CATG is a concolic unit testing engine for Java programs.  The implementation uses ASM for instrumentation.
ASM instrumentation instruments (see janala.instrument.*) class files at runtime and dumps (see janala.logger.*)
to a file a log of all instructions executed by the program and all values loaded from local stacks and heaps.
A concolic execution engine (see janala.interpreters.*) then takes the log and performs both symbolic and
concrete interpretation of the logged instructions.

You must have java, cvc3 (http://www.cs.nyu.edu/acsys/cvc3/download.html), and python 2.7 in your PATH.

    ant build
    python testall.py

This runs the tests using online concolic execution.  To run tests with offline concolic execution, use

    python --offline testall.py
